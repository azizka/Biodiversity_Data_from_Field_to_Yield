## Library setup
```{r}
require(speciesgeocodeR)
require(tidyverse)
require(rgdal)
```

## 1. Biome classification
```{r}
# load data
dat <- read_csv("inst/occurrence_records_clean.csv")%>%
  data.frame()

# Load Olson et al 2001 biomes
biom <- WWFload(x = "inst")
names(biom)

# Classify species
class <- SpGeoCod(x = dat, y = biom, areanames = "BIOME")

```

# 2. Write results to disk
```{r}
# summary graphs
WriteOut(class, type = "graphs")

# summary tables
WriteOut(class, type = "stats")

# Per species maps, dont do this for very large groups with more than 100 species
#WriteOut(class, type = "maps")

```

## 3. Format for downstream analyses
```{r}
# a) BioGeoBEARS
WriteOut(class, type = "BioGeoBEARS")

# b) Bayarea
WriteOut(class, type = "BayArea")

# c) Nexus
WriteOut(class, type = "nexus")
```

## 4. Occurrence threshold
It might be advisable to only classify a species to a habitat if more than one or two occurrences are in this habitat. This is especially the case, if the quality of the occurrence data is unclear. You can use the `Ã²cc.thresh` argument of `SpGeoCod` for this.

```{r}
# At least 20% of the records
class_thresh <- SpGeoCod(x = dat, y = biom, areanames = "BIOME", occ.thresh = 10)

class$polygon_table
class_thresh$polygon_table

```
