## Background
Patterns of species richness and occurrence density are relevant information for study design, to communicate study results or to check data quality in any multi-species occurrence dataset. Species distributions can be estimated with a large array of methods, but in some cases a rough and quick estimation of species ranges is more suitable. The extent of occurrence based on convex hulls is used in conservation and macroecology to approximate species' ranges.

## Outcomes
After this exercise you will be able to:
1. Visualize species richness patterns and occurrence record density in a quick and efficient way.
2. Estimate species distribution ranges based, and create polygons of species distributions.

## Exercise
1. Load the example data (we will use "bombacoideae_gbif.csv"), and visualize the coordinates on a map.
2. Visualize the number of occurrence records and the number of species in a regular-size grid.
3. Estimate the range and range size for each species using a convex hull. Write the range maps to the working directory as ESRI-shape files.
4. Visualize species richness per grid cell based on the range polygons.

## Library setup
You will need the following R libraries for this exercise, just copy the code chunk into you R console to load them. You might need to install some of them separately.

```
require(speciesgeocodeR)
require(raster)
```
