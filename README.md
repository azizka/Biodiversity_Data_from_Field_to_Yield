# Before the course
Please:

* Read the course [literature]()

* Download the [knowme.earth app](https://knowme.earth/) to your phone

* Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) on your computer

* Open R studio and install the necessary dependencies by copying the code below into the R consol and runing it. 

Please do not hesitate to [contact us] if you have any questions.


# Installation
Please run the following code (just copy it into the R consol) before the course to make sure all dependencies are installed and we can start smoothly.

```{r}

# Objectives
1.	Exemplify the various uses of biodiversity data for exploratory and question-driven research in ecology, evolution and biogeography 

2.	Familiarize participants with new bioinformatic tools for handling and processing ‘big data’, including dealing with data errors and biases 

3.	Provide the participants with a workflow to use large scale species occurrence data for biodiversity analyses (including point localities and range maps)

4.	Provide an overview of how to use R for analyzing large datasets of species occurrences (including data mining, visualization, exploration, cleaning and applications)


# Background
The public availability of large-scale species distribution data has increased drastically over the last ten years. In particular, the digitalization of collections from museums and herbaria, the input from human and machine observations, and the aggregation of information in public databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) have contributed significantly to this development. This is leading to a ‘big data’ revolution in biogeography, which holds an enormous but still poorly explored potential for understanding large scale patterns and drivers of biodiversity.
